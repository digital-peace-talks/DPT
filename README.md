## Digital Peace Talks

# About

Digital Peace Talks is (and always will be) a free and open web app that maps opinions via an artificial intelligence and uncovers high quality dialogues. The Digital Peace Talks offer:

You can open or join a discussion for any question that is on your mind. Anyone can give one single answer and, with that, express their opinion on the topic. Every user acts anonymously, protected by a random and encrypted ID.

Yes, anonymity bring forth the depths of the human soul.That is the reason why Digital Peace Talks distinguish strictly between the expression of opinion of a person and the exchange of opinion between two people.

You can ask any person that has published an opinion to a personal one-on-one dialogue.

At the end of the dialogue you can rate the exchange. The dialogue is marked as a line between your opinions on a 3D map. the line's color indicates the course that the dialogue took.

You can see who stirs things up, who is hurtful and who manages to build bridges.

Every dialogue is published. The result is a three-dimensional space, where every opinion belonging to a question is visible.

Now you can filter all the opinions and dialogues, for example by only showing the dialogues that are rated positively or negatively. That way you can see where bridges between camps have already been built and where they haven't.

You can also set criteria for the kind of offers you get for one-on-one dialogues.
